### Notes

We'll start off with some very simple HTML and work through manipulating the elements through the corresponding nodes in the DOM. 

```index.html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Document Object Model</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>What is the DOM?</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

If we look at these elements as a hierarchy of nodes, then we can represent them something like this:

- html
    - head
        - title
            - text: "Document Object Model"
    - body
        - p
            - text: "What is the DOM?"

And we will go from there.
